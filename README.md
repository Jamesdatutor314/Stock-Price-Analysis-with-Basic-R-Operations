# Stock Price Analysis with Basic R Operations
By James Weaver

# Introduction
This project explores weekly stock price data using basic operations in the R programming language. It includes fundamental analytical tasks such as calculating averages, filtering stock prices based on conditions, and identifying days with the highest or lowest prices. The project also uses data visualization techniques to showcase stock price trends effectively.

# Files
1. stock_price_analysis.R: The main R script containing all analytical operations, logical checks, and visualizations.
2. README.md: This documentation describing the project, methods, and outputs.
3. stock_prices_plot.png: Visualization of stock prices across days of the week.

# Analysis
The analysis includes:
1. **Vector Creation**: Stock price data for the week is stored in a vector.
2. **Day Assignment**: Each stock price is labeled with a corresponding day of the week.
3. **Statistical Operations**:
- Calculated average stock price for the week.
- Summed total weekly stock price.
4. **Logical Filtering**: Identified stock prices above or below certain thresholds.
5. **Condition Based Filtering**:
- Filtered days where stock prices exceeded $23.
- Identified days with below-average stock prices.
6. **Visualization**: Created a bar plot using ggplot2 to visualize stock price trends over the week.
